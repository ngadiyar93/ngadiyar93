## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I am a graduate student pursuing PhD with the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) at UW-Madison.

My research focuses on electric machine design and optimization along with power electronics and control. 

I currently work on Off-Highway vehicle electrification :tractor: :pick: and a list of my publications :books: can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CPd0z5gAAAAJ)

__Note:__ Officially, I only have one name (Nishanth) which causes my name to appear as FNU Nishanth across systems in the USA where first name and last name are mandatory (FNU stands for First Name Unknown). So, I prefer being called Nishanth and not FNU :smile:

### Open-Source Projects
- __Electric machine modeling framework ([eMach](https://github.com/Severson-Group/eMach)):__
I am one of the developers of eMach where I focus on interfacing Infolytica MagNet with Matlab. eMach was successfully used with Matlab's GA toolbox to optimize axial flux machines for my research.

- __Matlab to LT Spice ([Matlab2LTSpice](https://github.com/ngadiyar93/Matlab2LTSpice)):__
This repository is a result of interesting discussions with Sangwhee Lee, a fellow graduate student at WEMPEC over the course of three semesters.
I am the lead developer on this project which aims to link Matlab to LT spice to automate spice solves and (in future) go towards parasitic extraction and PCB layout optimization.

- __Inductor Optimization ([InductorOptimizer](https://github.com/ngadiyar93/InductorOptimizer)):__ 
Optimizing an inductor is very critical for power electronic applications. However, compared to motor optimization, the design space is quite constrained due to limited core geometry available. As an extension to an independent study I did in Spring 2020, I have been working with a fellow graduate student (Sangwhee Lee) in developing an inductor optimization framework. The beta release is available and is currently being tested. A stable release will be updated soon. Stay tuned!
