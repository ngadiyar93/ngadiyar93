## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I am a graduate student pursuing PhD with the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC) at UW-Madison.

My research focuses on electric machine design and optimization along with power electronics and control. 

I currently work on Off-Highway vehicle electrification :tractor: and a list of my publications :books: can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=CPd0z5gAAAAJ)

__Note:__ Officially, I only have one name (Nishanth) which causes my name to appear as FNU Nishanth across systems in the USA where first name and last name are mandatory (FNU stands for First Name Unknown). So, I prefer being called Nishanth and not FNU :smile:

### Open-Source Projects
- Electric machine modeling framework (eMach)

I am one of the contributors to eMach where I focus on interfacing Infolytica MagNet with Matlab. More info [here](https://github.com/Severson-Group/eMach)
